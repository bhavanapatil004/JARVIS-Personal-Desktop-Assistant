Subject: Application for Sick Leave

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I am writing to inform you that I am unable to attend work for the next few days due to illness. I woke up this morning feeling unwell, and after consulting with my doctor, I have been advised to take a few days off to rest and recover.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and assure you that I will do my best to catch up on any missed work once I return. I will keep you updated on my progress and let you know as soon as I am able to return to work.

In the meantime, if there are any urgent tasks that need to be addressed, please let me know, and I will do my best to assist from home.

Thank you for your understanding and support during this time.

Sincerely,
Snigdha Kapuri
